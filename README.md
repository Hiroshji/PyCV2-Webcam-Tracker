# YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection

A Python-based real-time object detection application using the YOLOv8 model, OpenCV, and PyTorch. The program captures video from a webcam, processes each frame to detect objects, and displays bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected objects in fullscreen mode.

## 1️⃣ Features
- Real-time object detection using **YOLOv8**.
- Supports **GPU acceleration** with PyTorch and CUDA.
- Displays detected objects with labels and confidence scores.
- Resizeable Window.

## 2️⃣ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics YOLOv8

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python torch ultralytics
